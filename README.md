## Lammps-Benchmarks

Simple benchmarks for Lammps, CPU and GPU, from Pawsey times.

Two models available:
- Lennard-Jones: standard one from Lammps repo and tutorials, easy to compare with benchmarks available publicly, but only testing one force-field type
- Water: more comprehensive model, with multiple force-field types (including Coulomb, that uses the FFT package)
